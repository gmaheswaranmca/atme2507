Great! Since you're interested in using **Pandas** for data engineering on **Digital Engineering Services**, here’s a full setup with:

* ✅ A **sample dataset** to download
* 📦 How to load it with **Pandas**
* ⚙️ What **data engineering tasks** you can try on it

---

## ✅ Sample Dataset: *IoT Device Telemetry Data*

**Download Link (CSV):**
👉 [Download iot\_telemetry\_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-python-raspberrypi-client-app/master/data/iot_telemetry_data.csv)

This dataset simulates telemetry data from digital devices — temperature, humidity, and message types from different devices.

---

## 📂 Dataset Columns:

| Column         | Description                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `device_id`    | Unique identifier of the IoT device    |
| `temperature`  | Temperature reading from the device    |
| `humidity`     | Humidity reading                       |
| `message_type` | Type of message sent (e.g., telemetry) |
| `timestamp`    | Event time                             |

---

## 📦 Load in Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-python-raspberrypi-client-app/master/data/iot_telemetry_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Preview
print(df.head())
```

---

## ⚙️ Data Engineering Tasks to Try with Pandas:

### 1. **Data Cleaning**

```python
# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill or drop missing values
df = df.dropna()
```

---

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

```python
# Convert timestamp to datetime
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])

# Create a new feature: high temperature alert
df['high_temp'] = df['temperature'] > 70
```

---

### 3. **Aggregation and Grouping**

```python
# Average temperature per device
avg_temp = df.groupby('device_id')['temperature'].mean()
print(avg_temp)
```

---

### 4. **Time Series Analysis**

```python
# Set timestamp as index
df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)

# Resample to hourly average
hourly_avg = df.resample('1H').mean()
print(hourly_avg)
```

---

### 5. **Filtering & Exporting**

```python
# Filter out alerts
alerts = df[df['high_temp'] == True]

# Save to CSV
alerts.to_csv("high_temp_alerts.csv", index=False)
```
