## File Operations in Python

### Reading/Writing Text Files
```python
# Writing to a file
with open('example.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

### Working with CSV Files (Manual Parsing)
```python
with open('data.csv', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        values = line.strip().split(',')
        print(values)
```

### JSON File Handling
```python
import json
# Writing JSON
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
# Reading JSON
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(data)
```

### Error Handling with try-except
```python
try:
    with open('nofile.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('File not found!')
except Exception as e:
    print('Error:', e)
```
